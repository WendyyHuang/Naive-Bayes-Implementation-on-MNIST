# Implementing Naive Bayes on MNIST
## Overview
This project implements a Naive Bayes classifier to distinguish between handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model applies a Bernoulli Naive Bayes approach, treating pixel intensities as binary values. 
## Results
It eventually achieves about 83% accuracy.
